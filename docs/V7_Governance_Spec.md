# V7 Governance Specification

## Purpose
V7 defines what is allowed to operate within the architecture. It is the authority layer that sets boundaries, permissions, and prohibitions.

## Scope
- Governs all components, tools, and integrations.
- Cannot be overridden by lower layers (V5 or V6).
- Does not implement features; it constrains them.

## Governance Principles
- **Non-Delegable Authority:** Governance cannot be delegated to tools or components.
- **Explicit Policy:** All governing rules must be written, inspectable, and versioned.
- **Human-Centered Priority:** Governance must prioritize clarity, safety, and interpretability.
- **No Self-Validation:** No component may claim to validate its own compliance without external checks.

## Governance Rules
- Tools may not modify governance rules at runtime.
- Components must declare their governance dependencies.
- Any action affecting global state must pass a governance check.

## Compliance and Enforcement
- Governance checks must be enforced at integration boundaries.
- Non-compliant components must be rejected or sandboxed.
- Governance violations must be logged and reviewable.

## Change Management
- Governance changes require:
  - documented rationale,
  - review,
  - version increment.
- Breaking governance changes must be clearly communicated.

## Versioning
- V7.x versions track governance rule changes.
- Prior versions must remain archived for auditability.
